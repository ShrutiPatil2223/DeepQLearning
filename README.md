Deep Q-Learning is a reinforcement learning technique that combines Q-Learning, an algorithm for learning optimal actions in an environment, with deep neural networks. It aims to enable agents to learn optimal actions in complex, high-dimensional environments. By using a neural network to approximate the Q-function, which estimates the expected cumulative reward for each action in a given state, Deep Q-Learning can handle environments with large state spaces. The network is updated iteratively through episodes, using a combination of exploration and exploitation strategies. However, care must be taken to mitigate instability caused by non-stationarity and divergence issues, typically addressed by experience replay and target networks. Deep Q-Learning has proven effective in training agents for various tasks, including video games like Flappy bird
